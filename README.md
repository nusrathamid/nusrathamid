### Hi, I am Shihab ðŸ‘‹

<!-- Bio -->
I operate as a full-stack developer with over three years of professional experience. I specialize in building back ends using TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB as the database. Moreover, I have been comfortable working with PHP, Python, SQL, Bash, Redis, Elasticsearch, among other cutting-edge technology. I am currently employed as a Software Engineer at [Toptal](https://toptal.com). Besides programming, computer gaming is a hobby of mine.
